# OS
My OS mini project. The task was to replicate the functionality of the history command.

To try this on your machine 
1. ```git clone https://github.com/roh-7/OS.git```
2. ```cd OS```
3. ```./mini.sh```

To run this command globally
1. ``` cp mini.sh ~/../../usr/local/bin```
2. ``` cd ~/../../usr/local/bin```
3. ``` mv mini.sh <name_of_the_script_you_want>```
4. ```chmod +x <name_of_the_script>``` (This makes your file an executable file)

Now this can be executed from anywhere as a normal command.
